# Singular
PHP 7 MVC Framework

### Tech

Singular uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Slim](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim) - Slim is a PHP micro framework
* [Slim Framework Twig View](https://github.com/slimphp/Twig-View) - Twig templating component
* [Monolog](https://seldaek.github.io/monolog/) - Logging for PHP component

### Install the Application

Run this command from the directory in which you want to install your new Singular Framework application.

```sh
composer create-project sandortibor89/singular [my-app-name]
```

Replace [my-app-name] with the desired directory name for your new application.
